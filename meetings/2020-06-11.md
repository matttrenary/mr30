## Summary
### Aligned on
* We want to compete nationally
* We recognize that admissions help is critical
    * Most likely path to achieve this is varsity status
	* However, we’ll explore all options such as university contacts
* Our dual mission is on-field excellence and participatory club experience
    - We will ensure rugby opportunities for all Michigan students

### Other significant notes
- Women's team needs consideration
- Desire unity across teams, including Ann Arbor men's club (aka the city club, and comprising the non-student Michigan Rugby players)

### Outstanding questions
- How best to maintain unity if varsity + club is the chosen vision?

### Detailed notes
* Introductions
	* Haldane re: Michigan Rugby “All I would know is winning”
* Rose
	* Put a stake in the ground that we can work back to
	* The one thing that will establish the club and give it a solid foundation is a field and clubhouse
* Question about women’s team involvement
	* Yes, they'll be involved and conversations have already occurred
    * They desire varsity status
* Questions about what varsity means
	* Athletics and Club Sports serve different missions, and therefore provide different administration
		* Athletics is focused on excellence
		* Club Sports is focused on participation and student-led model
* Questions about club-varsity
	* It used to exist when club sports was in the Athletics Department
    * Mainly to promote some excellence among higher performing clubs
    * Pretty much gone but some discussions a few years ago. Fell apart partly due to Club Sports and Athletics not taking it on
    * Other schools have this status such as Penn State
    * Depends on which department ultimately houses it but there could be benefits of shared services such as trainers or tutors
* Questions about men's club
    * This is focused on the collegiate side but if work here can help men's club that's a good thing
    * No combined college / men's clubs out there
* Schiller
	* Connection to Air Force women’s coach Amy Rusert who leads NIRA and is pushing for varsity across the country
	* Club sports was closer to varsity back in 60s
		* Strong relationship with Athletics and Don Canham
		* Treated differently than other club sports
		* Voice of all the club sports at some point
			* Club Sports Council leaders were rugby players
		* Disappointing this relationship doesn’t exist
* Questions about scholarships vs admissions help
	* Different things
		* Scholarships
			* Framework exists for NCAA women’s rugby for maximum scholarships
			* Small schools out there provide help
				* Likely few full rides
			* Cal men don’t offer scholarships
				* Perhaps don’t want to fund it
				* Perhaps school doesn’t
		* Admissions
			* Getting into school, regardless of whether you’re getting scholarship help or not
			* Athletics is currently the only way right now
	        * **Admissions is the biggest separator of teams**
	        * Any scenario without admissions help needs to come with lowered expectations
* Questions about 7s vs 15s as a multiple team varsity / club setup
	* We have handled different sides within one team and haven’t seen a separation socially
	* 7s team competing at CRC was a varsity experience
		* Palladino
			* Held ourselves to a higher standard
			* No additional resources or access
				* The whole thing off of grit
				* If we had more resources that would of catapulted us further
        * No real recognition of efforts
            * Trenary
	            * Good example of differences of departments
	            * And it’s all on us! The U isn’t going to make rugby great unless we do the work here
* Various intermixed comments (mainly Haldane and Rose) about club and varsity
    * Varsity deduced as the way forward, especially considering admissions
    * Could have all the money in the world but would struggle if we can't get rugby players on campus
    * Want to see excellence through all teams
    * Want to see unity
        * Recognize varsity and club need to be separate given rules and administration
        * But would lose a lot if not one entity
* Question as to what’s next?
		* Take our vision to the university
            - They’re supportive but will have critiques
            - But won’t do anything unless we’re driving it
* Question about U funding
	* Likely not. At least we shouldn’t expect it.
* Schiller knows Ted Spencer the former Admissions director
		* Would be good to get his opinion on how to move forward toward admissions help
* Working group structures
    * Forwards
