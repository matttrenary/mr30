        - Disperate audiences
          - Thinks biggest donors might not be alumni. Parent or random person.
        - Frech: See how it lies via Improved Player Support and potentially segment more.
          - And agrees that big donor might be out of scope currently.
      - Seibert
        - Rosasco has redone MRF site. Can house a lot of content for MR30, etc.

          - Trenary: Men have quarterly newsletter
          - Frech: Yeah, may want to audit what we all are doing
- Facility
  - Talking about major gifts and lead donors as 1a

    - Most lead donors right now, are probably coming from annual donors

    - Starting within FTF
    - Then MR30
    - Then connections from there

    - Passive targets. Some efforts via messaging but lots of unknown.
    - General targets from greater community, and pull 1x1 from that
      - Groups/decades to get to 1x1
  - Tossing around ways in how to bring in greater group to make them feel as though they are building the facility
    - "I'd like to see this" "I've seen this in the past"
  - Trenary: Avoid crosstalk / duplicated work
  - Palladino:
    - Brainstorm of what the facility could look like. List of things of what it could be. Could be motivating.
