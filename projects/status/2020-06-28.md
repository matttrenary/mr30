## Week's Discussion
- Haldane:
    -Seeking clarification on our pursuit of alternative admissions help as opposed to declaration of varsity pursuit
- Lisi:
    -If varsity path is chosen, alignment with women is a must since:
        - We can help the women take advantage of NCAA initiative
        - Equity should ultimately help men's team
- Frech:
    - Desires men's and women's collaboration and united front
    - Women have been looking at how to get to a higher level of competition. Decided upon varsity pathway.
    - Now part of Collegiate Rugby Association of America, same umbrella org as men
