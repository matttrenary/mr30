### Clarify collaboration between men's and women's teams
- Unanimous support for collaboration
- No issues with soliciting for joint projects

### Prioritize field/fieldhouse
- Address outstanding Elbel questions and feasibility study
    - Given the delayed state of Rec Sports facility work and a lack of lead donor, we'll need to develop our working vision without knowing Elbel details
- Rec Sports identified Elbel as the most likely location for a rugby project
- Discussions and [research](../misc/index.md) ongoing
- Clarify what details (location, cost, timeline, control, etc.) are necessary to confirm before including in working vision

### Estimate and prioritize campaign fundraising goals
- Includes
    - Milestones
    - Field/fieldhouse prioritization
    - Clarity of collaboration between men's and women's teams
- Bodner, Frech, Rojano, Seibert, and Trenary continuing to draft iterations of working vision to drive goal prioritization
- Bodner identified initial operational needs which have been included in draft iterations

## Upcoming projects
