## Previous Week's Discussion
- Haldane:
    - Seeking clarification on whether our investigation of alternative admissions assistance precedes decision on varsity pursuit

    - If varsity path is chosen, alignment with women is a must since:
        - We can help the women take advantage of NCAA initiative
        - Equity should ultimately help men's team
- Frech:
    - Desires men's and women's collaboration and united front
    - Women have been looking at how to get to a higher level of competition. Decided upon varsity pathway.
    - Now part of Collegiate Rugby Association of America, same umbrella org as men

    - Need to clarify whether this alignment is dependent on men's pursuit of varsity
