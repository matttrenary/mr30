## Project Updates
### Estimate and prioritize campaign fundraising goals
- Bodner, Frech, Rojano, Seibert, Trenary continue work on draft Working Vision iterations

### Prioritize field/fieldhouse
- Without lead donors, our vision will include facility desires and options but no hard cost or timeline
- Facility will be pursued in parallel to other vision items
    - The first step is to find potential lead donors
