# Field use
## Estimate football
Total rugby hours/year: 1756
Anticipated maintenance hours/year: 175.6
Average rugby hours/month: 36.6
Rugby Assumptions
- Calculations based on three 15s sides, 7s sides, and intrasquad competition for both men and women
-- 7s sides calculated as half of a 15s side
- Outside groups such as the city team get several hours per week in March and November as potential cover during worse weather months
- Some hours estimated for camps/clinics and special events
- Likely more of an underestimate than an overestimate

## Better Field Guidelines
### Maintenance
- For every 10 hours of use, 1 hour of maintenance is projected
- Additional quarterly maintenance should also be considered
- Necessary maintenance equipment is projected to be 2-3% of total project cost
### Lifetime use
- Usage is generally labeled low, medium, and high. Above 35 hours per week lands the estimation in the medium usage band. 
- Rugby exceeds 35 hours/week six months of the year. Rugby exceeds 50 hours/week (high) five months of the year. 
- Expected lifespan for playing surface (the carpet) products receiving medium usage is 10 years 
- The cost of playing surface replacement is estimated to be at least $650,000.
- Facility rental can be used to fund playing surface replacement, though, exceeding 60 hours/wk of average is expected to decrease expected lifespan to less than 7 years.

## Construction
- Construction of any field project will most likely commence in April to allow for an opening in August
- Earlier construction is likely not feasible due to weather
- Later construction, July at the latest, could be considered if all teams continued to utilize alternate facilities 

## Takeaways
- Rugby can/will account for over 50% of a field's use, which underlines the need for priority access, if not some control over scheduling.
